        <a href="#three">Go to the end</a>
      </div>
      <p>Take you like a drug</p>
      <p>I taste you on my tongue</p>
      <p>You ask me what I'm thinking about</p>
      <p>I tell you that I'm thinking about</p>
      <p>Whatever you're thinking about</p>
      <p>Tell me something that I'll forget</p>
      <p>And you might have to tell me again</p>
      <p>It's crazy what you'll do for a friend</p>

      <p>Go ahead and cry, little girl</p>
      <p>Nobody does it like you do</p>
      <p>I know how much it matters to you</p>
      <p>I know that you got daddy issues</p>
      <p>And if you were my little girl</p>
      <p>I'd do whatever I could do</p>
      <p>I'd run away and hide with you</p>
      <p>I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too</p>

      <div class="hood" id="two"></div>
      <p>I tried to write your name in the rain</p>
      <p>But the rain never came</p>
      <p>So I made with the sun</p>
      <p>The shade</p>
      <p>Always comes at the worst time</p>

      <p>You ask me what I'm thinking about</p>
      <p>I tell you that I'm thinking about</p>
      <p>Whatever you're thinking about</p>
      <p>Tell me something that I'll forget</p>
      <p>And you might have to tell me again</p>
      <p>It's crazy what you'll do for a friend</p>

      <p>Go ahead and cry, little girl</p>
      <p>Nobody does it like you do</p>
      <p>I know how much it matters to you</p>
      <p>I know that you got daddy issues</p>
      <p>And if you were my little girl</p>
      <p>I'd do whatever I could do</p>
      <p>I'd run away and hide with you</p>
      <p>I know that you got daddy issues</p>

      <p>I keep on trying to let you go</p>
      <p>I'm dying to let you know</p>
      <p>How I'm getting on</p>
      <p>I didn't cry when you left at first</p>
      <p>But now that you're dead it hurts</p>
      <p>This time I gotta know</p>
      <p>Where did my daddy go?</p>
      <p>I'm not entirely here</p>
      <p>Half of me has disappeared</p>

      <p>Go ahead and cry, little boy</p>
      <p>You know that your daddy did too</p>
      <p>You know what your mama went through</p>
      <p>You gotta let it out soon, just let it out</p>
      <p>Go ahead and cry, little girl</p>
      <p>Nobody does it like you do</p>
      <p>I know how much it matters to you</p>
      <p>I know that you got daddy issues</p>
      <p>And if you were my little girl</p>
      <p>I'd do whatever I could do</p>
      <p>I'd run away and hide with you</p>
      <p>I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too</p>

      <p>If you were my little girl</p>
